question 2 

sample input -- A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
sample output -- we want appropriate result


1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

answer---
i will first remove "=" and "space" from String. then

i will split the string into array with ",";

now our input will look something like this 

  String[] arr = {A1:5, A2:7, A3:9, B1:3, B2:8, B3:4+5, C1:5+A1, C2:A2+B2, C3:C2+B3};

	running a for loop on it 
	
	we will make a global MAP===> map=new HashMap();

	for(int i=0;i<arr.lenght;i++)
	{	
		we,ll split each index with ":";
		
		the we,ll get two index at each sub array
		run a loop again on sub array ;
		
		ex: {A,5} or {B3,9};
		
		now this subarray element at zero index is our key for map;
		and value is at 1st index of subarray
		we,ll check at every index of subarray that weather the key in the map is presnt or not
		if present we,ll assign the value from the map to the value of other key . 
		till the time A1 key was made then 1st index came it checked weather 5 key is present or not
		if 5 is not presnt then it have convert the string into integer and stored the value for A1; 
		 
		example {
			A1=5,
			A2=7,
			A3=9
			}
		
			
		


	}  
	we,ll get our map desried map


	simply run a loop on map and get the desired output;
	

2. What type of errors you would you check for?

	i will check for index out of bound,
	i will check weather my key in the hashmap is null or not .


 3. How might a user break your code?
i  user can break the code by providing any thing which is a symbol in place of Intger value of A1 or A2.
