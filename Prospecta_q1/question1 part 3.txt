3) Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?


i will keep all feilds private
and expose my class with model mapper so that client do not have acces to direct access of my entity

will also make proper exceptional handling using global exceptional handler

use some annotations valid keeps checks and balance on client to insert appropriate data
